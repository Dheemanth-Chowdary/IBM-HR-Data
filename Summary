### Key Insights  

- **Recruitment**: LinkedIn and Indeed yield the highest recruitment success, while job fairs and advertisements show low efficiency.  
- **Diversity**: Gender distribution is relatively balanced (57% male, 43% female), but further diversification across departments is necessary.  
- **Turnover**: The overall turnover rate stands at 33%, indicating a critical need for enhanced retention strategies.  
- **Termination Causes**: Most terminations are due to absenteeism or career shifts, varying significantly across departments.  
- **Employee Satisfaction**: The Production department shows high satisfaction, whereas other departments lag in engagement.

### Recommendations
